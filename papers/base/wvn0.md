## 2. Clear Abstract
The paper introduces **Wild Visual Navigation (WVN)**, a vision-only system that **learns traversability online** from a few minutes of human teleoperation. It uses features from a self-supervised ViT, generates supervision on the robot in real time, and adapts quickly to new environments. WVN bootstraps a usable traversable-terrain segmentation in **<5 minutes**, enabling autonomous navigation in forests, parks, and grasslands, including a **1.4 km autonomous path-following run**. Although demonstrated on ANYmal, the approach is applicable to other ground robots.

## 4. Problem Addressed
Traditional geometry-based navigation (e.g., elevation maps) often misclassifies **high grass/undergrowth** as obstacles. WVN seeks to **learn platform-specific traversability from vision** with **online adaptation** instead of relying on fixed semantic classes or offline training.

## 5. Innovation / Main Contribution
- **Real-time self-supervision** combining vision with **proprioception/control tracking error** to derive dense traversability labels online.
- **Lightweight learner on top of self-supervised ViT features** trained onboard for fast adaptation.
- **Hybrid objective**: supervised traversability + **anomaly-based confidence**, enabling conservative behavior in unlabeled regions.
- **Closed-loop integration** with mapping and SDF-based local planning for autonomous navigation.

## 6. Key Methods / Architecture
- **Feature extraction:** DINO-ViT dense features → 100 **SLIC** superpixels → per-segment embeddings.
- **Self-supervised labels:** **Velocity tracking error** vs. reference (smoothed; mapped via sigmoid) → continuous traversability score.
- **Graphs:** **Supervision graph** (short horizon, robot footprint & scores) and **Mission graph** (images, segments, features) for continual reprojection & labeling.
- **Learning:** Two-head MLP (shared trunk):
  - **Reconstruction head** learns to reconstruct *visited* segment embeddings → **confidence** via reconstruction loss statistics.
  - **Traversability head** regresses scores with **confidence-weighted loss**; threshold selected online via ROC/FPR criterion.
- **Closed loop:** Project per-pixel traversability to **2.5D elevation map** (raycasting); build SDF; local SE(2) planner; learning-based locomotion controller.

## 7. Datasets & Experimental Setup
- **Robot:** ANYbotics **ANYmal C**; onboard **Jetson Orin AGX**; code in PyTorch/ROS1.
- **Sensors:** Monocular wide-FoV **Sevensense Alphasense Core** RGB camera; state estimator for pose/velocity; LiDAR/depth used **only** for elevation mapping.
- **Ablation datasets:** **Hilly**, **Forest**, **Grass** sequences (teleoperated data; train/val/test split described).

## 8. Evaluation Metrics & Results
- **Headline capability:** Bootstraps in **<5 min** of in-field training; **1.4 km** autonomous footpath following.
- **Autonomy demos:**
  - **Point-to-point in woods:** **8/8 goals** reached around trees after ~2 min demo.
  - **Kilometer-scale path following:** Three runs (0.55 km, 0.5 km, **1.4 km**); minor interventions at intersections; overly relaxed parameters caused mud misclassification.
- **Comparison vs geometry:** WVN correctly marks **high grass** traversable where geometric methods fail (spikes in elevation), improving SDFs for planning.
- **Ablations (Accuracy, GT labels):** WVN’s MLP vs RF/SVC across scenes—**Hilly 81.05%**, **Forest 82.45%**, **Grass 78.21%**; best overall across methods.

## 9. Limitations
- **Velocity-error proxy** for traversability is simple and may miss interaction nuances.
- Projection to 2.5D map introduces artifacts; **single camera FoV** limits coverage.
- **Superpixel coarseness** can blend traversable/untraversable regions.
- Runtime ~**2.5 Hz** (unoptimized); continual learning across missions not addressed.

## 10. Similarity / Relevance to Our Work
**Our idea:** unified mapping+navigation with **geometry + semantics + terrain properties (friction, roughness) + traversability** (urban + offroad).

- **Overlap:**
  - WVN provides a **vision-based traversability layer** and integrates it with a **2.5D elevation map + SDF planner**, aligning with our multi-layer mapping and local planning pipeline.
  - Emphasis on **fast in-field adaptation** from minimal supervision matches our need for robust deployment across diverse outdoor settings.
- **Divergence:**
  - WVN **does not estimate physical terrain properties** (friction/roughness) explicitly and is **vision-only** for traversability labels; our plan fuses **geometry and physical properties**.
  - WVN focuses on **natural/off-road**; our scope includes **urban/semi-structured** scenes.
- **How it informs us:**
  - The **confidence-weighted loss + anomaly reconstruction** is a principled way to handle unlabeled regions—useful for fusing uncertain layers in our map.
  - **Online, on-robot labeling** via **velocity tracking error** is a low-cost supervision signal we can reuse alongside friction estimates to adapt costs per robot/platform.

**Our current limitations vs WVN:** We don’t currently perform **on-robot online learning** for traversability; WVN shows it can be done quickly and safely with minimal compute and supervision.

## 11. Potential Integration Points
- **Add a WVN-like “visual traversability” layer** into our multi-layer map (alongside elevation, semantics, and friction). Use their **raycast fusion + exponential averaging** to accumulate evidence.
- **Confidence-guided fusion:** Use WVN’s **reconstruction-based confidence** to **downweight** unobserved/uncertain areas when composing the planning cost.
- **Self-supervision signals:** Start with **velocity error** as a universal label source; later combine with **proprioceptive friction proxies** (slip, foot/ground reaction indicators) to learn property-aware costs.
- **Planner hookup:** Feed the fused costmap into our **A* (global) + MPC (local)**; WVN’s SDF-based local planner demonstrates immediate compatibility.

## 12. Open Questions / Future Work (from authors)
- Replace velocity-error proxy with **richer interaction metrics** per platform.
- **Improve projection/mapping** (multi-camera, better 3D fusion) to reduce artifacts and FoV gaps.
- Explore **continual learning** across missions/environments.

## 15. recap
What WVN does, start to finish:
- **Start with no labels.** Take monocular RGB + robot state. Segment image into ~100 **SLIC superpixels** and extract **DINO-ViT** features per segment.
- **Generate labels online.** While a human teleops briefly, compute a **traversability score** from **velocity tracking error**; reproject the robot’s traversed footprint into recent images using a **supervision graph** → per-segment labels.
- **Learn onboard.** Train a small **MLP** online: (1) **reconstruction head** learns distribution of traversed (positive) features to yield **confidence**; (2) **traversability head** regresses scores, **downweighting** uncertain segments and auto-selecting a threshold via **ROC/FPR**.
- **Fuse into map.** Raycast the predicted per-pixel traversability into a **2.5D elevation map**, temporally fuse, then build an **SDF**.
- **Plan & go.** An **SDF-based local planner** sends SE(2) twists to the locomotion controller; a **moving “carrot”** target yields autonomous exploration/path following.
- **Results.** After **<5 min** training, WVN navigates forests/parks, does **8/8** point-to-point goals among trees, and performs **1.4 km** footpath following; outperforms geometry on **high grass**.
