## 2. Clear Abstract (150--200 words)

This paper presents an end-to-end locomotion system for a quadruped that
uses a single forward-facing **egocentric depth camera** and
proprioception to traverse challenging terrain such as stairs, curbs,
stepping stones, and gaps. Instead of building a metric elevation
map---which requires accurate state estimation and can be brittle---the
authors directly map sensing to joint targets at 50 Hz using a recurrent
policy with short-term memory. Training is done entirely in simulation
in two phases: (1) reinforcement learning on fast-to-compute
"**scandots**" (sampled terrain heights near the robot) to learn robust
behavior and (2) supervised **distillation** that replaces scandots with
depth images (processed by a convnet) via DAgger, yielding a deployable
policy that runs on limited onboard compute. The system demonstrates
high success rates across terrains, emergent specialized gaits (e.g.,
large hip abduction for high stairs), and robustness to perturbations
like pushes and slippery or rocky surfaces. Compared to "blind"
baselines and elevation-map pipelines with injected noise, the method
achieves substantially greater distance before failure and higher task
success in simulation and on a Unitree A1 in the real world.
