## 2. Clear Abstract (150–200 words)

This paper presents a fast, online local mapping and planning system for unmanned ground vehicles operating in unknown, off-road environments. The mapping stack fuses wheel odometry and GPS/IMU with a 32-beam LiDAR to build a local, wrapping grid map (≈50 m radius at 0.2 m resolution). From LiDAR, the method maintains min/max height per cell, marks obstacles when vertical extent exceeds a threshold (0.5 m), and computes a terrain gradient map; a normalized convolution fills holes. These layers are merged into a simple, adaptable cost map at 10 Hz. Planning proceeds in two tiers: (1) an 8-connected A* search (5 Hz) over the local cost map provides a coarse path; (2) a trajectory sampler then generates ~1000 kinematically feasible motion candidates by sweeping angular rates and segment times across a short horizon (T≈3 s), scoring them by map cost, curvature penalty, distance-to-goal, and heading error. The lowest-cost feasible trajectory is issued to an ILQR-based controller at 30 Hz. Experiments on a Clearpath Warthog at the Texas A&M RELLIS campus demonstrate real-time operation at 3–4 m/s (vehicle top speed 4.5 m/s), weaving through cones and along brush-lined trails. The approach prioritizes speed and practicality, trading formal optimality for robust, feasible paths that adapt online.

## 4. Problem Addressed

Develop a real-time local mapping + planning pipeline for unknown, unstructured off-road terrain where obstacles and traversable vegetation are ambiguous, ensuring collision-free, kinematically feasible motion at vehicle-limit speeds.

## 5. Innovation / Main Contribution

- A compact, **wrapping local map** with ROI management and buffered multi-scan fusion enabling fast updates.  
- **Composite cost map** combining obstacle likelihood (from per-cell height span) with **terrain gradient** and certainty, updateable at 10 Hz.  
- **Two-stage planner**: optimal A* over the local cost map + **greedy, kinematics-aware trajectory sampling** that tracks the A* path while respecting differential-drive limits.  
- A lightweight **trajectory scoring** that blends map cost, curvature penalty, distance, and heading terms to run at 30 Hz on-board.

## 6. Key Methods / Architecture

- **Sensors & State Estimation**
  - VLP-32C LiDAR; VN-300 GPS/IMU; wheel odometry fused via EKF.
- **Local Map**
  - 512×512 grid, 0.2 m resolution (~50 m radius); ring buffer of recent scans; ROI ensures validity during motion.
- **Point-Cloud to Layers**
  - Per-cell min/max height; obstacle flag if (max−min) > 0.5 m; certainty mask; normalized convolution to fill holes; gradient from filled height.
- **Cost Map**
  - Weighted combination of obstacle, gradient, certainty; robot-radius inflation.
- **Planner**
  - A*: 8-connected, Euclidean heuristic (5 Hz).  
  - **Trajectory sampler** (T≈3 s): assume constant speed; sample ω∈[0,ω_max], segment times T1,T2,T3 (right–straight–left and left–straight–right), ~10×10×10 ≈ 1000 candidates; pure-pursuit target along A* with lookahead T·V_max.  
  - **Cost** \(C(t)=\text{Map}(t)+\alpha\frac{\omega}{\omega_{max}}+\beta \text{Dist}(t)+\gamma \text{Herr}(t)\).
- **Control**
  - ILQR controller executes the chosen trajectory.

## 7. Datasets & Experimental Setup

- **Robot:** Clearpath Warthog (differential drive), top speed 4.5 m/s.  
- **Sensors:** Velodyne VLP-32C LiDAR; VectorNav VN-300 GPS/IMU; wheel encoders.  
- **Site:** Texas A&M RELLIS campus.  
- **Scenarios:** (1) Cone slalom in grassy field; (2) ~50 m brush-lined off-road trail.  
- **Rates:** mapping 10 Hz; A* 5 Hz; trajectory sampling 30 Hz; tests at 3 m/s (near limit: 3–4 m/s).

## 8. Evaluation Metrics & Results

- **Throughput:** Full pipeline sustains **30 Hz** trajectory selection; mapping/cost-map at **10 Hz**; A* at **5 Hz**.  
- **Vehicle speed:** Demonstrated at **3 m/s** with a platform rated to **4.5 m/s**.  
- **Qualitative outcomes:** Successfully threads through cones and follows a narrow off-road path with small deviations driven by local gradient updates; trajectories remain collision-free and feasible.  
- **Note:** No aggregate success rates, energy use, or ablation studies reported; evaluation is primarily qualitative with timing and speed figures.

## 9. Limitations (w.r.t. our human-preference, terrain-aware navigation with BEV semantics, elevation mapping, and MPC+CBF)

- **No semantic understanding:** Cost maps rely on height span and gradient—no BEV terrain classes (sidewalk/grass/snow) or human-preference weights.  
- **Elevation only via 2.5D span/gradient:** Lacks explicit slope/curb semantics or high-fidelity elevation fusion (e.g., multi-sensor elevation grids).  
- **Greedy local optimality:** The sampler is greedy to its endpoint; can get stuck if the A* track is infeasible; no global planner integration (acknowledged by authors).  
- **Safety guarantees:** No MPC or control-barrier-function (CBF) constraints—feasibility is empirical, not provably safe.  
- **Dynamic/semantic obstacles:** Moving agents and social norms are out of scope; semantics are listed only as future work.

## 10. Similarity / Relevance to Our Work

- **Overlap**
  - Uses **local elevation/gradient cues** to shape a cost map and steer trajectories around rough terrain—useful for our elevation-aware layer.  
  - Real-time **A* + local trajectory sampling** is a practical baseline planner for semi-structured outdoor spaces.
- **Divergence**
  - No **BEV semantic terrain** nor **human-preference** modeling; lacks **MPC+CBF** safety constraints and **global plan** consistency.

## 11. Potential Integration Points

- **Wrapping local map & ROI buffering:** Adopt their ring-buffer map to fuse multi-scan elevation and maintain a fixed-latency local window; plug in our BEV semantics as additional layers.  
- **Normalized convolution hole-filling:** Use their normalized convolution step to stabilize sparse elevation/semantic BEV fusion.  
- **Composite cost design:** Start from their obstacle+gradient+certainty cost and inject **human-preference weights** per semantic class; keep robot-radius inflation for safety.  
- **Sampler warm-start for MPC+CBF:** Use their fast trajectory sampler to generate feasible seeds; then refine within our **MPC with CBF constraints** to add guarantees.  
- **Lookahead logic (T·Vmax):** Reuse the A*-anchored pure-pursuit target policy to stabilize our horizon selection and reduce planner thrash.

## 12. Open Questions / Future Work (from the authors)

- Integrate **semantic segmentation** to distinguish traversable vegetation vs. true obstacles and to handle moving obstacles.  
- Couple with a **global planner** to avoid greedy global behavior outside the local ROI.

## 13. Reproducibility Notes

- **Provided details:** Sensor suite, grid size/resolution, obstacle threshold (0.5 m), update rates, and cost-function form are described.  
- **Missing specifics:** No code link; weighting coefficients (α, β, γ) and many implementation constants are not enumerated; hardware-specific tuning implied.  
- **Overall:** **Moderate** reproducibility for experienced robotics teams; exact results likely require re-tuning and similar sensors/platform.
