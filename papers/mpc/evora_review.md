## 2. Clear Abstract
EVORA presents a unified framework for **off-road robot navigation** that learns terrain traction and plans risk-aware trajectories. Rather than hand-designing costs from terrain features, the system learns traction distributions—how much a robot slips relative to commanded velocity—directly from data. It models **aleatoric uncertainty** (inherent randomness such as visually identical terrain with different traction) and **epistemic uncertainty** (model uncertainty from unseen terrain).  
A neural network predicts discrete traction distributions, while a normalizing flow estimates latent feature densities to detect out-of-distribution (OOD) terrain. Training uses *evidential deep learning* and a new **uncertainty-aware squared Earth Mover’s Distance (EMD²) loss**, which improves prediction accuracy and OOD detection.  
For planning, EVORA employs a **risk-aware Model Predictive Control (MPC)** scheme. It simulates trajectories with the *worst-case expected traction* (handling aleatoric uncertainty) and penalizes paths through high-epistemic-uncertainty terrain. Extensive simulations and hardware tests with wheeled and quadruped robots show faster, safer navigation than baselines assuming nominal traction or only expected costs.

## 4. Problem Addressed
How to **navigate off-road terrain quickly and safely** when traction is uncertain and training data are limited, requiring explicit handling of both **inherent terrain randomness** and **model uncertainty**.

## 5. Innovation / Main Contribution
- **Dual uncertainty modeling:** Simultaneous quantification of **aleatoric** and **epistemic** uncertainty in traction prediction.  
- **Novel loss:** Closed-form, uncertainty-aware **squared EMD² loss** combined with evidential learning for better multi-modal traction estimation.  
- **Integrated pipeline:** Tight coupling of uncertainty-aware traction learning with a **risk-aware MPC planner** using CVaR for worst-case traction and OOD avoidance.

## 6. Key Methods / Architecture
- Learn **categorical traction distributions** from semantic + elevation patches.  
- Evidential network outputs parameterize a **Dirichlet distribution** to capture prediction confidence.  
- **Normalizing flow** estimates latent feature densities for OOD detection.  
- **Multi-objective loss** = Uncertainty-aware EMD² + Uncertainty-aware Cross Entropy − Entropy regularization.  
- **Planner**: Sampling-based MPC (MPPI) with  
  - Left-tail CVaR of traction for worst-case simulation,  
  - Auxiliary penalties for high-epistemic-uncertainty terrain.

## 7. Datasets & Experimental Setup
- **Synthetic 3D terrains** with known traction distributions for benchmarking loss functions and OOD detection.  
- **Real-world**:  
  - Clearpath Husky (wheeled) and Boston Dynamics Spot (quadruped).  
  - Semantic elevation maps built with LiDAR + RGB using PointRend segmentation on the RUGD dataset (24 semantic classes).  
  - Outdoor forests and indoor racing tracks with vegetation obstacles for hardware trials.

## 8. Evaluation Metrics & Results
- **Prediction:** Earth Mover’s Distance (EMD²), KL divergence, AUC-ROC/PR for OOD detection.  
- **Planning:** Success rate and time-to-goal in go-to-goal tasks.  
- **Highlights:**  
  - Hybrid UEMD² + UCE loss yields **lowest EMD² error** and best OOD detection.  
  - Risk-aware planner achieves **higher success rate and faster travel** than baselines assuming nominal or expected traction, and competitive with CVaR-of-cost methods at lower computation cost.

## 9. Limitations
- **Environment assumptions:** Focused on traction; does not directly encode human social preferences or explicit semantic desirability.  
- **Computational load:** Normalizing flows and MPC still require GPU acceleration for real time.  
- **Elevation use:** Elevation integrated for traction prediction, but not explicitly fused with human preference or comfort.  
- **Our project gap:** No modeling of **human-preference cost layers**, BEV semantic mapping, or MPC with control barrier functions.

## 10. Similarity / Relevance to Our Work
- **Overlap:**  
  - Uses **semantic + elevation maps** to learn terrain-dependent cost (traction), akin to our BEV semantic + elevation fusion.  
  - Employs **MPC planning** under uncertainty, conceptually related to our MPC + CBF framework.  
- **Divergence:**  
  - Focuses on *physical risk (traction)* rather than *human comfort or social norms*.  
  - No explicit human preference weighting across terrain types.

## 11. Potential Integration Points
- **Evidential uncertainty modeling** could enhance our BEV semantic/elevation cost map with calibrated risk estimates.  
- **CVaR-based planning** could complement our MPC+CBF to handle aleatoric uncertainty (e.g., slippery surfaces).  
- **Normalizing-flow latent density** for OOD detection may help reject unseen terrain classes or sensor anomalies.

## 12. Open Questions / Future Work
- Scalability to more complex robot dynamics beyond unicycle/bicycle models.  
- Extension to richer semantics and dynamic obstacles.  
- Combining human preference with physical risk for holistic navigation.  
- Reducing compute cost for embedded deployment.

## 13. Reproducibility Notes
- Code and data are promised on the [project website](https://xiaoyi-cai.github.io/evora).  
- Synthetic datasets and detailed network/planner parameters are described for replication.  
- Requires GPU for real-time MPC and normalizing flow inference.
