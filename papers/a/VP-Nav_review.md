## 2. Clear Abstract
This work introduces **VP-Nav**, a navigation framework for quadruped robots that combines visual perception with proprioceptive sensing. Standard vision-only planners can miss key terrain cues such as slipperiness, softness, or invisible obstacles like glass walls, while proprioception alone lacks global awareness. VP-Nav fuses both modalities: onboard cameras create a 2-D occupancy and cost map to plan a path, while proprioceptive feedback continuously updates safety constraints, detects collisions, and limits walking speed on unstable terrain. A reinforcement-learned, velocity-conditioned locomotion policy executes these commands, adapting online to environment changes via rapid motor adaptation. Experiments in simulation (Habitat/Gibson maps in RaiSim) and on a Unitree A1 robot show that VP-Nav achieves 7–15% higher success rates than vision-only or wheeled baselines in environments with invisible obstacles, rough or slippery surfaces, and varying payloads. The system runs entirely onboard and requires only modest computation, demonstrating robust, real-world navigation across complex indoor and outdoor terrains.

- Legged robot navigation  
- Vision–proprioception fusion  
- Reinforcement learning locomotion  
- Safety advisor module  
- Fast Marching Method (FMM) planning  
- Collision detection from proprioception  
- Rapid Motor Adaptation (RMA)

- Complex terrain traversal

## 4. Problem Addressed
How can a legged robot safely and efficiently navigate to a goal in complex, partially observable environments where vision alone cannot sense hidden obstacles or terrain properties (e.g., slipperiness, deformability), and where low-level locomotion capabilities must influence high-level planning?

## 5. Innovation / Main Contribution
- **Tight coupling of vision and proprioception** for navigation, enabling detection of invisible obstacles and terrain characteristics.  
- **Safety Advisor Module** that estimates collision probability and safe velocity limits directly from proprioceptive history.  
- **Velocity-conditioned RL locomotion policy** with rapid motor adaptation for online environment inference.  
- **End-to-end onboard system** that runs asynchronously on a low-cost Unitree A1 quadruped.

## 6. Key Methods / Architecture
- **Visual Planner**
  - Onboard RGB-D cameras → 2-D occupancy map (Intel RealSense D435 + T265).
  - Cost map = geodesic distance (Fast Marching Method) + obstacle distance.
  - PID controller outputs continuous linear and angular velocity.
- **Velocity-Conditioned Walking Policy**
  - RL-trained policy tracks commanded velocities using proprioception and extrinsics vector.
  - Rapid Motor Adaptation infers environment conditions online.
- **Safety Advisor**
  - Collision detector: predicts unseen obstacles from proprioceptive history.
  - Fall predictor: estimates 1s fall probability to adjust speed limits.
- **Integration**
  - All modules run asynchronously (planner 10 Hz, locomotion 100 Hz, safety 10 Hz).

## 7. Datasets & Experimental Setup
- **Simulation**: Matterport3D and Gibson maps imported into RaiSim with varied terrains (flat, rough, slippery) and invisible obstacles.  
- **Hardware**: Unitree A1 quadruped with Intel RealSense D435 depth + T265 tracking cameras, onboard computation only.  
- **Scenarios**: Rough terrain patches, slippery surfaces with varying friction, hidden obstacles (e.g., glass), and dynamic payload changes.

## 8. Evaluation Metrics & Results
- **Metrics**: Success Rate, SPL (Success weighted by Path Length), time-to-goal, energy consumption.  
- **Highlights**:
  - +5–15% success improvement with proprioceptive collision detection vs. vision-only.
  - 7% higher success in slippery/rough terrain with fall predictor.
  - Continuous velocity planner is 27% faster than discrete alternatives.
  - Legged VP-Nav vastly outperforms wheeled LoCoBot on rough terrain (≈95% vs. 15–69% success).

## 9. Limitations
- Locomotion module is not directly conditioned on vision; cannot climb or jump obstacles.
- Assumes reliable onboard depth sensing for map creation.
- Focused on quadruped scale and may not directly extend to larger platforms.

**Relation to Our Project:**  
Compared to our human-preference BEV semantic navigation, VP-Nav lacks explicit *semantic* reasoning, elevation mapping, or human-centric cost modeling. It emphasizes physical safety and proprioceptive feedback rather than human-like terrain preference.

## 10. Similarity / Relevance to Our Work
- **Overlap**:  
  - Uses **BEV occupancy mapping** and continuous cost-based planning.  
  - Integrates **safety constraints** into MPC-like velocity control.  
- **Differences**:  
  - Our approach adds **semantic terrain classes** and **human-preference costs**.  
  - We incorporate **elevation mapping** and plan to fuse with **MPC + Control Barrier Functions**.  
  - VP-Nav is primarily reactive to hidden hazards, not human social norms.

## 11. Potential Integration Points
- Incorporate a **proprioceptive safety advisor** to dynamically adjust velocity limits in our MPC controller.  
- Use **rapid motor adaptation** ideas to handle changing terrain friction in elevation-aware mapping.  
- Apply their **continuous velocity-commanded policy** as a low-level controller beneath our human-preference cost maps.

## 12. Open Questions / Future Work
- Extending to vision-conditioned locomotion for climbing/jumping.  
- Scaling to larger robots or outdoor unstructured environments.  
- Integrating semantic scene understanding with proprioceptive safety.

## 13. Reproducibility Notes
- Training details, simulation setups, and hardware specs are provided.  
- No explicit code repository mentioned, but supplementary materials and videos are linked on the project page.  
- Requires Intel RealSense hardware and RaiSim simulation for full replication.
