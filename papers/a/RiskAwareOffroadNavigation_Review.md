## 2. Clear Abstract (150–200 words)

This paper proposes a traversability representation that models how fast a robot can move through off‑road terrain as a **distribution of achievable speeds** conditioned on semantic context and commanded speed. Rather than treating terrain classes (e.g., grass, bush) as uniformly traversable, the method learns a speed probability mass function (PMF) from data gathered while driving, capturing multi‑modal outcomes such as “free roll” versus “stuck.” The learned distribution is converted into a multi‑layer **speed map** and summarized for planning by a convex combination of the distribution’s **mean** and its **Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR)**, enabling intuitive, tunable risk sensitivity without retraining. The map plugs into a minimum‑time planner using **Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI)** control. Experiments include a controlled grid‑world and an off‑road Unity simulation with a Clearpath Warthog in a full autonomy stack. Results show improved navigation reliability and reduced time‑to‑goal compared with risk‑unaware baselines; risk tuning trades average speed for higher success rates. The approach provides an interpretable, unit‑consistent (m/s) layer that bridges semantic perception and risk‑aware planning, and it is computationally lightweight enough for real‑time deployment with modest CPU resources.

## 3. Keywords

- Risk-aware navigation (CVaR)
- Traversability learning
- Speed distribution map (PMF)
- Semantic terrain mapping
- Off-road autonomy
- MPPI (information-theoretic MPC)
- Costmap integration
- Clearpath Warthog
- Unity high-fidelity simulation

## 4. Problem Addressed

How to plan **fast and reliable** paths in off‑road environments where coarse semantic labels (e.g., “vegetation”) hide large variability in traversability, and where **risk tolerance must be tunable** without rebuilding models. The core challenge is linking semantics to **achievable speed** (hence time‑to‑goal) in a way usable by standard planners.

## 5. Innovation / Main Contribution

- Defines traversability as a **conditional distribution of realized speeds** given commanded speed and local semantics.  
- Introduces a **risk-adjusted speed map** using a convex combination of **mean** and **CVaR\_α** of the learned distribution, offering **interpretable, unit‑consistent tuning** of risk without retraining.  
- Integrates this map into a **minimum‑time MPPI** planner and shows improved success rates in simulation with a full autonomy stack.

## 6. Key Methods / Architecture

- **Learning target:** \(p_\theta(s \mid s_{\text{cmd}}, o)\) where \(o\) encodes local terrain semantics.  
- **Training data:** tuples \((s_{\text{cmd}}, \text{terrain class}, s_{\text{realized}})\) collected via joystick driving.  
- **Network:** 2×64‑ReLU MLP; input = one‑hot terrain + commanded speed; output = 10‑bin speed PMF (0–5 m/s) via softmax.  
- **Speed map:** \(K\)-layer (per speed band) grid; each cell stores \(m_{k,h,w} = \beta \cdot \mathrm{CVaR}_\alpha + (1-\beta)\cdot \mathbb{E}[s]\).  
- **Planner:** MPPI (derivative‑free, sampling‑based) with stage cost scaled by inverse risk‑adjusted speed; terminal cost uses default speed estimate.  
- **Risk control:** \(\alpha\) (CVaR tail) and \(\beta \in [0,1]\) (risk weight).  
- **Unknown regions:** treated conservatively (0 m/s) unless domain knowledge suggests otherwise.

## 7. Datasets & Experimental Setup

- **Platforms & env:** Clearpath **Warthog** in a high‑fidelity **Unity** off‑road scene; ARL autonomy stack.  
- **Terrain semantics:** dirt vs. vegetation; ~¼ of “bushes” within vegetation are non‑traversable.  
- **Data collection:** ~3 minutes of teleop driving ⇒ ~7k samples (vegetation), ~2k (dirt).  
- **Map resolution:** top‑down 100×100 semantic grid, 0.4 m/cell; 10 commanded‑speed layers × 10 output speed bins.  
- **Compute:** NN eval for a 10‑layer 100×100 map in **<2 ms** on 8‑core CPU; mean and CVaR extraction ≈ **15 ms** and **150 ms** respectively; map published at **2 Hz**.  
- **Planner params:** MPPI with **500 rollouts**, **5 s** horizon at **20 Hz**; wheel‑speed noise σ ≈ **5 rad/s**.  
- **Benchmarking:** multiple start/goal pairs (max ~35 m); goal radius **3 m**; timeout **40 s**.

## 8. Evaluation Metrics & Results

- **Metrics:** success rate, average speed on successful trials, time‑to‑goal.  
- **Grid world:** combining mean + CVaR reduces variance vs. mean‑only and avoids over‑conservatism vs. CVaR‑only.  
- **Unity/Warthog:** increasing β from **0 → 0.6** raises success rate **42% → 72%**, with modest reduction in average speed.  
- **Headline:** risk‑aware planner improves success vs. risk‑unaware baselines; authors report up to **~30% improvement** in navigation success for the full stack.

## 9. Limitations (w.r.t. our project: human‑preference, terrain‑aware navigation with BEV semantics, elevation mapping, and MPC+CBF)

- **No explicit human preference model:** cost is tied to physical **speed outcomes**, not social/comfort norms (e.g., preferring sidewalks over grass).  
- **Coarse semantics; no elevation fusion:** terrain is dirt/vegetation; **no slope/curb modeling** or fusion with elevation grids.  
- **Planner lacks safety certificates:** MPPI does not provide hard‑safety guarantees like **CBFs**; unknown regions default to 0 m/s but constraints aren’t enforced lyapunov‑style.  
- **Sim‑heavy validation:** Unity environment with semantic ground truth; generalization to outdoor real‑world sensing pipelines is untested.  
- **Compute for CVaR extraction:** current CPU extraction ~150 ms and 2 Hz updates may bottleneck tighter control loops.  
- **Vehicle/terrain specificity:** distributions depend on platform and season/terrain; transfer across robots or conditions is not addressed.

## 10. Similarity / Relevance to Our Work

- **Overlap:** Uses a **top‑down semantic grid** and plugs a learned layer into planning; shares our emphasis on **risk‑aware route selection** beyond pure geometry.  
- **Divergence:** Optimizes for **time via speed** rather than **human‑preference costs**; omits **elevation** and **CBF‑based safety**.  
- **Takeaway:** Their **risk‑adjusted speed map** is a strong candidate for our traversability prior that can be fused with our **human‑preference cost** and elevation layers.

## 11. Potential Integration Points

- **Dual‑layer cost map:** fuse their risk‑adjusted **speed layer** with our **human‑preference terrain costs** (semantic BEV + elevation). For instance:  
  - \(J = \lambda_1 \cdot \text{time}(S_{\text{risk}}^{-1}) + \lambda_2 \cdot C_{\text{human}}(\text{semantics}, \text{elevation})\).  
- **Risk‑aware constraints in MPC+CBF:** use \(S_{\text{risk}}(p,s)\) to set **state‑dependent speed limits** or **control barrier margins** (e.g., enforce \(v \le S_{\text{risk}}(p, v)\)).  
- **Observation design:** extend \(o\) to include **elevation features** (slope, step, roughness) and **BEV semantics** to learn speed PMFs that reflect both geometry and semantics.  
- **Online β/α tuning:** adapt risk weight using **preference feedback** (e.g., penalize bumpy/undesirable surfaces) or realized vs. commanded speed discrepancies.  
- **Cold‑start priors:** initialize PMFs from physics/heuristics (e.g., snow ⇒ low mean & low CVaR) and refine with data.

## 12. Open Questions / Future Work (from authors + our lens)

- **Automatic risk tuning:** learn β online from performance gaps.  
- **Uncertainty sources:** incorporate OOD detection and segmentation uncertainty into PMFs.  
- **Richer observations:** add geometric cues (elevation) and finer semantics.  
- **Better terminal cost:** learn a cost‑to‑go estimator for MPPI.  
- **Real‑world transfer:** evaluate with real sensors and seasonal changes; cross‑platform generalization.  
- **Preference modeling:** how to align speed‑based risk with **human comfort/social norms**.

## 13. Reproducibility Notes

- **Code/data release:** not specified in the paper.  
- **Environment dependence:** relies on a high‑fidelity **Unity** scene and ARL autonomy stack.  
- **Model simplicity:** small MLP (2×64), PMF with 10 bins; all major hyperparameters and timing are reported, aiding re‑implementation.  
- **Sensors/labels:** simulation provides ground‑truth semantics; a real‑world replication would need a BEV semantic pipeline and careful data collection.
