## 2. Clear Abstract

The authors present a terrain-mapping framework that enables mobile
robots to build reliable elevation maps even when their global
localization drifts. Instead of depending on GPS or visual features, the
system fuses range sensor data (e.g., stereo camera or LiDAR) with
purely proprioceptive odometry from kinematic and inertial sensors. The
mapping is performed in a *robot-centric* frame so that new measurements
are always referenced to the robot's current pose. This design naturally
handles drift in position and yaw because the local map "moves with the
robot." Each map cell stores a probabilistic height estimate and a full
3-D covariance, allowing the method to compute upper and lower
confidence bounds on terrain elevation. Additional processes propagate
uncertainty as the robot moves, fuse neighboring cells for a consistent
map, and perform visibility checks to handle dynamic environments.
Experiments with simulated data and legged robots show that the
probabilistic confidence intervals closely match ground truth while
running in real time, enabling safe foothold planning and navigation
without external localization.

## 3. Keywords

-   Probabilistic elevation mapping\
-   Robot-centric mapping\
-   Uncertain localization\
-   Grid-based terrain representation\
-   Range sensor fusion\
-   Covariance propagation\
-   Dynamic environment adaptation\
-   Legged robot navigation

## 4. Problem Addressed

Robots traversing rough terrain need accurate elevation maps for
planning. Conventional methods assume globally accurate localization,
which is unreliable without GPS or strong visual/geometric features. The
paper tackles mapping when only proprioceptive state estimation is
available, where position and yaw inevitably drift.

## 5. Innovation / Main Contribution

-   **Robot-centric probabilistic mapping** that avoids global frames
    and directly accounts for pose uncertainty.\
-   Full 3-D covariance propagation and confidence-bound computation for
    each grid cell.\
-   A two-stage pipeline (fast data collection, deferred map fusion)
    enabling real-time operation.\
-   Extensions for dynamic environments via visibility-based cell
    removal and adaptive noise injection.\
-   Demonstrated on legged robots using only onboard sensing.

## 6. Key Methods / Architecture

-   **Range-sensor update:**
    -   Transform depth points to map frame; update cell height via 1-D
        Kalman filter.\
-   **Robot-motion update:**
    -   Propagate covariance for each cell based on relative pose
        change; handle unobservable yaw/position drift.\
-   **Map fusion:**
    -   Compute weighted empirical CDF of neighboring cells to output
        mean, lower, and upper confidence bounds.\
-   **Dynamic adaptation:**
    -   Add constant noise to speed updates when terrain lowers.\
    -   Visibility ray-tracing to remove cells violating line-of-sight
        constraints.\
-   **Implementation:** C++ ROS library built on the Grid Map framework.

## 7. Datasets & Experimental Setup

-   **Simulation:** Synthetic terrain with controlled uncertainty to
    verify confidence bounds.\
-   **Hardware:**
    -   Legged robots *ANYmal* and *StarlETH*.\
    -   Depth sensors: PrimeSense Carmine 1.08, RealSense/Kinect,
        Hokuyo, Velodyne (noise models supported).\
    -   Ground truth via Leica MS50 laser scanner and optical motion
        capture.\
    -   Map resolution: \~1 cm grid; 20 Hz update rate.

## 8. Evaluation Metrics & Results

-   **Metrics:** Terrain height error vs. ground truth;
    confidence-interval coverage; qualitative top-view and profile
    comparisons.\
-   **Headline Findings:**
    -   Actual terrain consistently lies within the predicted 95 %
        confidence bounds.\
    -   Superior accuracy compared to prior Fankhauser 2014 and Kleiner
        2007 methods, especially near edges and under motion
        uncertainty.\
    -   Real-time performance suitable for online planning.

## 9. Limitations

-   Uncertainty below the robot grows when it steps in place, reducing
    map fidelity---problematic for fine footstep planning.\
-   Assumes stationary terrain aside from explicit dynamic-environment
    extensions.\
-   Relies on range sensors; performance depends on their noise models
    and visibility.\
-   No direct semantic understanding or human-preference modeling,
    unlike our BEV semantic + elevation approach.\
-   No integrated MPC or control-barrier-function planning.

## 10. Similarity / Relevance to Our Work

-   **Overlap:**
    -   Both target rough, semi-structured outdoor navigation.\
    -   Uses elevation mapping and probabilistic uncertainty, valuable
        for our elevation-aware cost maps.\
-   **Divergence:**
    -   Their focus is purely geometric; no semantic terrain classes or
        human-preference cost modeling.\
    -   Mapping is robot-centric, whereas we maintain a global BEV
        semantic map fused with elevation.\
    -   Control layer (MPC + CBF) absent.

## 11. Potential Integration Points

-   Incorporate their **robot-centric uncertainty propagation** into our
    elevation layer to quantify confidence in BEV semantic grids.\
-   Use their **map fusion and confidence bounds** to weight terrain
    costs or adapt CBF constraints.\
-   Visibility-based dynamic adaptation could help keep our
    human-preference map current when obstacles move.

## 12. Open Questions / Future Work

-   Better handling of prolonged stationary operation to limit
    uncertainty growth.\
-   Fusion of proprioceptive mapping with semantic perception and
    learned preference models.\
-   Extension to full 3-D (beyond 2.5-D) or to deformable/soft terrain.\
-   Coupling mapping uncertainty directly into motion planning and
    control.

## 13. Reproducibility Notes

-   Open-source ROS/C++ implementation:
    <https://github.com/ethz-asl/elevation_mapping>.\
-   Supports common depth sensors with included noise models.\
-   Requires standard ROS setup and compatible range sensors; simulation
    scripts available.
