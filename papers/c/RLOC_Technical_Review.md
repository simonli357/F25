## 2. Clear Abstract

This work presents **RLOC**, a modular control framework for quadruped
robots to traverse challenging, uneven terrain. The system combines
**reinforcement learning (RL)** with **model-based optimal control**. A
key RL module plans footsteps using onboard proprioceptive and
exteroceptive sensing, including an elevation map. A model-based
whole-body motion controller then tracks these planned footholds at high
frequency, ensuring dynamic stability and safety. Two auxiliary RL
policies enhance robustness: a domain-adaptive torque tracker that
compensates for modeling errors or changing dynamics, and a recovery
controller that reacts to large disturbances or foot slips. Policies are
trained in simulation using domain randomization and a denoising
autoencoder for terrain-feature encoding, then transferred directly to
real robots. Experiments with ANYmal B and C quadrupeds show reliable
locomotion over stairs, slopes, grass, and muddy surfaces without
retraining, demonstrating zero-shot transfer between robot platforms.
The framework achieves stable, terrain-aware locomotion while reducing
training time compared to prior methods.

## 4. Problem Addressed

Robust, **terrain-aware locomotion** for legged robots that can
dynamically traverse complex, uneven ground while remaining stable and
transferable to different robot hardware without retraining.

## 5. Innovation / Main Contribution

-   **Unified RL + Optimal Control architecture** that plans perceptive
    footholds while a model-based controller enforces dynamic
    constraints.\
-   **Three-policy modular design** (footstep planner, domain-adaptive
    tracker, recovery controller) enabling fast training and zero-shot
    transfer across robots.\
-   **Denoising convolutional autoencoder** to encode noisy elevation
    maps for sim-to-real robustness.

## 6. Key Methods / Architecture

-   **Footstep Planning RL Policy**: Maps robot state + encoded
    elevation map to desired footholds.\
-   **Model-Based Motion Controller**: Tracks center-of-mass and foot
    trajectories via hierarchical QP at 400 Hz.\
-   **Domain-Adaptive Tracker**: RL module outputs corrective joint
    torques to handle modeling errors and dynamic variations.\
-   **Recovery Controller**: RL policy for rapid disturbance rejection
    (e.g., large pushes, foot slips).\
-   **Terrain Encoder**: Denoising autoencoder compresses 91×91
    elevation patches to latent features.\
-   **Training**: Soft Actor-Critic, TD3, and PPO algorithms in RaiSim
    simulator with extensive domain and terrain randomization.

## 7. Datasets & Experimental Setup

-   **Simulated Terrains**: 10k procedurally generated heightmaps
    (stairs, waves, bricks, random obstacles).\
-   **Robots**: ANYmal B (30 kg) for training and ANYmal C (50 kg) for
    zero-shot transfer.\
-   **Sensors**: Onboard LiDAR/depth camera for elevation mapping; full
    proprioception (IMU, joint encoders).\
-   **Simulation**: RaiSim physics engine with actuator network modeling
    real joint dynamics.

## 8. Evaluation Metrics & Results

-   **Metrics**: Velocity-tracking error, stability margin, energy
    consumption, foot slippage, recovery from perturbations.\
-   **Headline Findings**:
    -   Stable locomotion on stairs, mud, grass, and slopes.\
    -   Zero-shot transfer to ANYmal C without retraining.\
    -   Training time \< 32 h for the footstep planner vs. \~454 h
        reported for DeepGait baseline.\
    -   Recovery controller withstands lateral pushes over twice the
        magnitude tolerated by baseline MPC.

## 9. Limitations (vs. Our Project)

-   Focused on **robot stability and dynamic locomotion**, not **human
    terrain preference** or socially aware cost maps.\
-   Uses elevation grids but **no semantic terrain labeling** or
    explicit modeling of human comfort/safety preferences.\
-   Primarily quadruped-specific; adaptation to wheeled or hybrid
    platforms would need additional work.\
-   MPC is embedded but not combined with **Control Barrier Functions
    (CBF)** for formal safety guarantees.

## 10. Similarity / Relevance to Our Work

-   Strong overlap in **terrain-elevation mapping** and **MPC-based
    tracking**.\
-   Demonstrates **sim-to-real transfer** of terrain-aware control,
    valuable for our BEV + elevation fusion.\
-   Shares the goal of **human-like terrain reasoning** only in the
    sense of "terrain awareness," not preference modeling.

## 11. Potential Integration Points

-   **Denoising elevation-map encoder** could improve our BEV semantic
    map robustness to sensor noise and occlusion.\
-   **Domain-adaptive torque tracking** suggests ways to enhance our
    MPC + CBF controller's resilience to modeling errors.\
-   **Recovery RL module** offers ideas for disturbance-handling that
    could complement our CBF safety layer.

## 12. Open Questions / Future Work

-   How well does RLOC scale to longer-term autonomous missions with
    higher-level planning?\
-   Can the elevation encoder be extended to multimodal semantic inputs
    (e.g., fusing RGB semantics with height)?\
-   Would integrating formal safety constraints (CBF) further improve
    guarantees?\
-   Exploration of learning human-style terrain preference or social
    navigation behaviors remains open.

## 13. Reproducibility Notes

-   **Code/Data**: Paper references video demonstrations and provides
    algorithmic details; no official code release mentioned.\
-   Requires high-performance computing for RL training and access to
    ANYmal hardware or equivalent simulation.
