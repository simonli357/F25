## 2. Clear Abstract
Legged robots can traverse rough, outdoor terrain, but their depth sensors often fail when the ground is hidden by vegetation or other penetrable materials. This paper introduces a method to estimate the true load-bearing support surface by fusing **proprioceptive** data—foot-tip contact positions—with **exteroceptive** sensing from a depth camera. A Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model creates a dense elevation map from sparse foothold measurements. Simultaneously, the system infers vegetation height by comparing each foot’s penetration depth to visible topography. These two estimates—a foothold-based map and a vegetation-subtraction map—are combined through adaptive weighting that accounts for terrain roughness and vegetation variability. Experiments with the ANYmal quadruped in fields and gardens containing tall grass and uneven ground show that the approach reliably predicts true terrain height even when visual data are missing or occluded. The method enables stable footstep planning and locomotion through dense vegetation and can degrade gracefully to purely proprioceptive mapping if exteroceptive sensors fail.

## 4. Problem Addressed
Legged robots require accurate ground geometry to plan safe footholds. Depth cameras and LiDAR often cannot see the true support surface when it is hidden by tall grass or other penetrable layers, causing planning errors and instability. The authors tackle the challenge of **estimating the real, load-bearing ground surface when exteroceptive sensors provide incomplete or misleading data**.

## 5. Innovation / Main Contribution
- **Dual-layer fusion** of proprioceptive foothold data and exteroceptive vegetation estimates to infer hidden support surfaces.  
- **Adaptive weighting** based on real-time variance of foothold and vegetation measurements to choose between proprioceptive and exteroceptive inputs.  
- **Occlusion-adaptive Gaussian Process Regression** for continuous, smooth elevation maps even with missing visual data.  
- Demonstration that the method seamlessly reverts to proprioception-only mapping during camera failure.

## 6. Key Methods / Architecture
- **Foothold Map Layer**: GPR-based interpolation of sparse foot-contact points.  
- **Vegetation Subtraction Layer**: Estimate vegetation height from difference between visible topography and foothold depth, then subtract to approximate ground height.  
- **Adaptive Weighting**: Combine layers using variance of foothold and vegetation measurements.  
- **Model Tiling**: Partition elevation map into overlapping tiles for computationally efficient GPR.  
- **Occlusion Adaptive Smoothing**: Adjust GPR kernel lengthscale depending on missing visual data.

## 7. Datasets & Experimental Setup
- **Platform**: ANYmal quadruped robot.  
- **Sensors**: Intel RealSense D435 depth camera, joint encoders for foot contact localization.  
- **Environments**:  
  - Agricultural field with wheat (vegetation 0.1–0.8 m).  
  - Unkempt garden with tall, variable vegetation and discrete step obstacles.  
- **Parameters**: GPR tile diameter 0.23 m; resolution 0.08 m.

## 8. Evaluation Metrics & Results
- **Metric**: Foothold Prediction Error (FPE) — difference between predicted and actual foot-tip height.  
- **Results**:  
  - In dense vegetation, support-surface estimation had significantly lower FPE than pure visible topography or blind (flat-ground) planning.  
  - On visible terrain, performance matched or slightly exceeded standard elevation mapping by correcting for state-estimation drift.  
  - Robust operation even with partial or missing depth data.

## 9. Limitations
- Relies on accurate joint state estimation; noisy proprioception can degrade results.  
- Tested primarily in vegetation; performance on sand, snow, or water not validated.  
- No explicit semantic terrain classification or human-preference modeling—**does not consider social or comfort costs** critical for our human-preference, terrain-aware navigation project.  
- Elevation-only focus; lacks integration with MPC or Control Barrier Functions (CBF) and no explicit BEV semantic mapping.

## 10. Similarity / Relevance to Our Work
- **Overlap**:  
  - Elevation mapping and fusion of proprioceptive and exteroceptive sensing are directly relevant to our plan to combine BEV semantic maps with elevation data.  
  - GPR-based interpolation could complement our elevation module, especially in occluded regions like tall grass or snow.  
- **Divergence**:  
  - The paper aims at *support surface estimation* for foothold stability, not *human-preference cost modeling*.  
  - No semantic segmentation or human-centric path costs.

## 11. Potential Integration Points
- Incorporate **occlusion-adaptive GPR** to fill gaps in our elevation grid when camera depth is unreliable.  
- Use their **variance-based adaptive fusion** as inspiration for weighting human-preference costs against uncertain elevation data.  
- Apply **foothold-based terrain probing** as an additional data source for MPC + CBF when visual semantics are ambiguous.

## 12. Open Questions / Future Work
- How to generalize to deformable or liquid surfaces like mud or snow.  
- Integration of tactile foot sensors for richer contact information.  
- Active probing strategies to improve estimation at sharp terrain transitions.  
- Visual priors for vegetation height prediction to reduce initial uncertainty.

## 13. Reproducibility Notes
- No public code release noted.  
- Method details (kernel equations, weighting formulas, GPR parameters) are fully described for re-implementation.  
- Hardware setup requires a legged platform with precise joint state estimation and a depth camera.
