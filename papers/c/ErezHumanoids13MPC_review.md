## 2. Clear Abstract (150–200 words)
The paper presents a full-body model-predictive control (MPC) system that runs in real time on a humanoid robot. The approach relies on fast, differentiable dynamics provided by MuJoCo and an iterative LQG trajectory optimizer that replans from the current state every few tens of milliseconds. Tasks are specified through a modular cost-function framework built from residuals and smooth norms; a human operator can mix or switch these costs at runtime. A lightweight state machine transitions between costs to compose complex behaviors (e.g., steps of a gait, getting up, entering a car). State estimation combines IMU signals with a no-slip prior for contacting limbs. Using a parallelized rollout/finite-difference pipeline on a 16-core machine, the controller plans ~0.5 s into the future with policy lags on the order of tens of milliseconds while commanding the robot at 1 kHz. The authors demonstrate locomotion, manipulation, and vehicle entry on the simulated Atlas platform from the DARPA Virtual Robotics Challenge, highlighting robustness to model mismatch, and discuss design trade-offs between horizon length, timing variability from contact, and cost specificity needed for real-time performance.

## 4. Problem Addressed
Enable **real-time**, full-body optimal control for high-DOF humanoids—without hand-crafted reduced models—so operators can specify high-level goals (costs) while the system autonomously generates feasible motions across diverse tasks.

## 5. Innovation / Main Contribution
- A complete **integrated system**: fast physics + iLQG MPC + residual-norm cost library + runtime cost mixing/switching + operator GUI, running **real time** for whole-body humanoid control.  
- **Cost-transition state machine** that composes behaviors by switching optimization targets rather than hand-coded controllers.  
- Practical engineering for speed: **smoothed contacts**, **non-uniform time steps**, and **parallel finite differencing** across horizon steps.

## 6. Key Methods / Architecture
- **Dynamics & derivatives:** MuJoCo provides fast forward dynamics and contact handling; derivatives via finite differencing (parallelized across cores).  
- **Optimizer:** iterative LQG (forward rollout + backward pass + line search), warm-started each MPC iteration.  
- **Timing:** New time-varying LQR policy every ~30 ms; **0.5 s horizon**; policy evaluated at **1 kHz**; policy lag observed ~11–36 ms.  
- **Costs:** Sum of weighted **norm(f(residual(x,u)))** terms (e.g., torque/velocity penalties; stability, orientation, end-effector reach). Smooth-abs and quadratic norms for differentiability.  
- **Cost transitions:** Simple state machine triggers between costs based on residual thresholds; optional model “alterations” at transitions (e.g., new foot target).  
- **Estimation:** IMU-based orientation, bias-calibrated acceleration integrated to velocity/position, corrected with a **no-slip** contact prior.  
- **System integration:** ROS nodes for perception/estimation/UI; MPC runs asynchronously on a dedicated machine; operator can adjust weights live.

## 7. Datasets & Experimental Setup
- **Platform:** Simulated **Atlas** humanoid.  
- **Simulator/stack:** Gazebo/ODE (robot/world), ROS for messaging, MuJoCo for control-oriented dynamics within MPC.  
- **Tasks:** Subset of **DARPA Virtual Robotics Challenge** tasks: driving, diverse-terrain locomotion, manipulation, and **entering a car** (multi-step sequence).  
- **Compute:** Two “field” computers (one MPC, one estimation/comm), 16-core CPU for parallel finite differencing.

## 8. Evaluation Metrics & Results
- **Real-time performance:** Control law updated every ~30 ms; executed at **1 kHz**; planning horizon ~**500 ms**.  
- **Timing statistics:** Policy lag histogram concentrated **11–36 ms**; lag increases with contact count but remains predictable.  
- **Behaviors demonstrated:** standing, in-place shuffle, walking via 4-state gait machine; getting up; car entry via sequenced costs.  
- **Robustness:** MPC tolerated model mismatch between MuJoCo (planning) and ODE (simulation); performance degraded mainly from estimation artifacts in ODE IMUs.

## 9. Limitations (w.r.t. *our* terrain-aware, human-preference BEV + elevation + MPC+CBF project)
- **No semantic/elevation aware mapping:** Control uses dynamics + generic costs; there is **no BEV terrain semantics** or **elevation-based risk** fused into planning.  
- **Preference modeling absent:** Costs encode stability/effort/kinematics—not **human-preference** terrain desirability (sidewalk vs. grass, etc.).  
- **Safety guarantees:** Uses iLQG with penalties and actuator limits; **no Control Barrier Functions (CBFs)** for formal safety/fence-keeping.  
- **Perception minimalism:** Relies on proprioception/IMU + contact priors; lacks camera-driven semantic context central to our pipeline.  
- **Complex tasks need supervision:** Many behaviors require **hand-designed cost sequences**; generalization without sequences is limited by horizon/timing.

## 10. Similarity / Relevance to Our Work
- **Shared core:** Real-time **MPC** with cost shaping and online re-optimization aligns with our **MPC** backbone.  
- **Composable objectives:** Residual-norm **cost library** and **runtime weight mixing** mirror our idea of terrain-preference weighting.  
- **Behavior composition:** **Cost-transition state machine** is analogous to switching objectives (e.g., on-sidewalk vs. crossing) in our navigation stack.

## 11. Potential Integration Points
- **Residual-norm cost design:** Use their smooth-abs/quadratic residual framework to encode **terrain-preference penalties** directly in the MPC objective (e.g., residual = “distance to non-preferred class pixels” in BEV).  
- **Cost switching/state machine:** Trigger cost sets based on **semantic/elevation events** (curb approaching, slope threshold crossed) to sequence micro-behaviors (e.g., cautious curb ascent).  
- **Non-uniform horizon:** Short steps for near-term barrier enforcement, longer steps for downstream preference shaping—useful when coupling **MPC + CBF**.  
- **Operator-in-the-loop tuning → preference learning:** Start with manual weight tweaks; then fit weights to human choices to learn **human-preference costs**.

## 12. Open Questions / Future Work (from the paper + for us)
- How to reduce reliance on **pre-scripted cost sequences** by extending horizon or incorporating **learning-based components**?  
- Can **state estimation** be improved (sensor fusion beyond no-slip) to stabilize MPC under real contact noise?  
- How to add **formal safety** (e.g., CBFs) without breaking iLQG’s efficiency?  
- Integrating **visual semantics and elevation** into the residual framework for terrain-aware planning.

## 13. Reproducibility Notes
- **Code/data availability:** The paper describes the system and gives a project page with videos; code is **not released** in the paper. Reproducing results requires MuJoCo, ROS, Gazebo/ODE and the described cost/estimation setup.  
- **Bib/venue confirmation:** Cited broadly as Humanoids 2013, pp. 292–299.
