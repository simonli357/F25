## 2. Clear Abstract (150–200 words)

The paper introduces **Wild Visual Navigation (WVN)**, an online, on-board system that learns **visual traversability** directly from RGB cameras during field operation. Starting with a brief human teleoperation, the robot uses **proprioceptive “traction” signals**—the discrepancy between commanded and actual velocity—to self-label what terrain is safe to cross. WVN leverages **pre-trained self-supervised visual features** (DINO-ViT and STEGO) to obtain rich per-pixel embeddings without manual labels, then trains a lightweight MLP online to predict traversability. To make this practical on embedded compute, the system includes **feature sub-sampling** (e.g., STEGO- or SLIC-based segments), **confidence estimation** via an autoencoder reconstruction loss, and **multi-camera scheduling** for wider coverage. WVN fuses predicted traversability into a standard elevation-map pipeline and drives a local planner, enabling autonomous behaviors within minutes. Real-world deployments on ANYmal quadrupeds show **rapid adaptation (<5 min)**, robustness in **high-grass and bushy** environments where geometry alone fails, **8/8 goal success** in cluttered woods after a short demo, and **kilometer-scale path following** in parks. Code, baseline models, and sample data are released to support reproducibility.

## 3. Keywords

- Visual traversability  
- Online self-supervision  
- DINO-ViT / STEGO features  
- Legged robots (ANYmal)  
- Multi-camera navigation  
- Confidence-aware learning (anomaly/reconstruction)  
- Terrain mapping & local planning  
- Path following in natural environments

## 4. Problem Addressed

Reliable **traversability estimation** in natural settings (grass, twigs, bushes) where purely geometric cues mislabel flexible vegetation as rigid obstacles; need for **fast, in-field adaptation** without large labeled datasets.

## 5. Innovation / Main Contribution

- **Online, on-board self-supervised learning** that adapts from a **short human demo** using only on-robot sensing and compute.  
- Use of **pre-trained self-supervised features** (DINO-ViT, STEGO) to drastically simplify learning and generalize semantics without manual labels.  
- **Confidence-weighted training** via an autoencoder that models feature familiarity (anomaly signal) to temper negative labels in untraversed regions.  
- **Multi-camera scheduler** (weighted round-robin) enabling concurrent supervision/inference from multiple views.  
- Practical **feature sub-sampling** strategies (STEGO/SLIC/random) and **pixel-wise inference** for fine-grained predictions.  
- **Open-source** ROS integration with baseline weights and sample datasets.

## 6. Key Methods / Architecture

- **Two-process pipeline:** (1) feature extraction & inference; (2) online learning loop.  
- **Visual features:** dense per-pixel embeddings from **DINO-ViT (384-D)** or **STEGO (90-D + masks)**; 224×224 input.  
- **Sub-sampling:** ~100 region embeddings via **STEGO segments**, **SLIC superpixels**, or **random** sampling.  
- **Traversability supervision:** convert **velocity error** (command vs. measured) into τ∈[0,1] via sigmoid; platform-tuned.  
- **Mission & supervision graphs:** project footprint-derived τ back into past views to label segments; accumulate for training.  
- **Confidence estimation:** per-segment autoencoder reconstruction loss → confidence c(f); Gaussian fit on positives.  
- **Traversability MLP:** confidence-weighted MSE over traversed/untraversed segments; automatic τ threshold via ROC at target FPR.  
- **Closed-loop integration:** raycasted visual τ fused into **2.5D elevation map**; **reactive local planner** outputs SE(2) twist.

## 7. Datasets & Experimental Setup

- **Platforms:** ANYbotics **ANYmal C/D**; additional **Jetson Orin AGX**; front/rear wide-angle RGB cameras.  
- **Environments:** **University Parks (Oxford)**, **Wytham Woods**, **Max Planck Institute (Tübingen)**—indoor→outdoor transitions.  
- **Software:** Python, **PyTorch**, **ROS1**; two ROS nodes sharing weights every 5 s.  
- **Resources:** **Open-source code**, baseline weights, **sample datasets**.

## 8. Evaluation Metrics & Results

- **Supervision metric:** τ from **velocity error/traction** (self-supervised).  
- **Fast adaptation:** visually meaningful segmentation after ~**2 min**; improves from seconds to minutes of training.  
- **Visual vs. geometric:** WVN remains permissive on **high grass** (true traversable) while geometry misclassifies due to elevation spikes.  
- **Autonomy between trees:** **8/8 goals reached** after ~2 min demo; no geometry used in training.  
- **Kilometer-scale path following:** runs of **0.55 km**, **0.5 km**, **1.4 km**; mostly centered on footpaths; occasional mud confusion.  
- **Multi-camera deployment:** improves FoV coverage; handles indoor glass vs. doors; outdoor walkways recognized as traversable.

## 9. Limitations

- **Supervision signal choice:** τ based on traction/velocity error may imperfectly reflect comfort/risk; authors flag it as an area for further study.  
- **Integration artifacts:** raycasting fusion and **SLIC** segmentation can introduce obstacles/over-segmentation.  
- **Preference vs. capability:** WVN optimizes *traversability-as-capability*, not human social/comfort preferences (implicit only via demos).

## 10. Similarity / Relevance to Our Work

- **Overlap:** Both aim for **preference-aware motion** in semi-structured outdoor scenes. WVN’s demo-conditioned behavior mimics where a human actually drove (e.g., staying on paths), aligning with our human-preference objective.  
- **Divergence:** WVN learns **robot-centric traversability** from traction, whereas our plan explicitly models **human terrain preferences** (sidewalks ≺ grass ≺ snow) in a **semantic BEV** with MPC+CBF.  
- **Takeaway:** WVN can supply a **robust, adaptive visual traversability prior** that we can fuse with our **human-preference cost map** to avoid capability-vs-preference conflicts.

## 11. Potential Integration Points

- **Feature backbone:** Use **DINO-/STEGO** embeddings as inputs to our **BEV semantic projection**, improving class-free terrain coherence.  
- **Confidence-aware mapping:** Port WVN’s **reconstruction-based confidence** to weight our cost layers and **down-weight OOD terrain**.  
- **Online self-supervision:** Incorporate **traction-derived τ** as an auxiliary signal to *refine* human-preference weights on the fly (e.g., when snow/ice reduces feasible choices).  
- **Multi-camera scheduler:** Adopt their **weighted round-robin** camera scheduling to maintain real-time BEV updates with limited compute.  
- **Automatic thresholding:** Use WVN’s **ROC-based τ thresholding** (target FPR) to calibrate “allowed vs. discouraged” terrain in our planner.

## 12. Open Questions / Future Work (from the authors)

- How to **improve/validate traction-based τ** as a surrogate for true traversability and user-desired behavior?  
- How to **enhance fusion** of visual τ with elevation maps beyond simple raycasting?  
- Further analysis of **pixel-wise vs. segment-wise** inference across environments and features.

## 13. Reproducibility Notes

- **Code & models:** Open-source ROS implementation with baseline weights. **Project page and sample datasets** available.  
- **Hardware/software details:** ANYmal C/D + Jetson Orin; PyTorch/ROS1; processes as separate ROS nodes.
